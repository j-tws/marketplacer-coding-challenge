# About Marketplacer

# Marketplacer's core product is an e-commerce platform for online marketplaces that connects customers to a range of products to buy. We'd like you to build a checkout system for one of our marketplaces.
# The Challenge

# Your application should contain the following functionality:

#     Load a list of products from a file.
#     List product details to the user.
#     Add products to a Shopping Cart.
#     Apply promotional discounts.
#     Calculate and display the total cost.

# You can find the list of available products in the attached file products.json

# List of available promotions is provided below:

#     10% off on total greater than $20
#     15% off on total greater than $50
#     20% off on total greater than $100

# The output might but doesn't have to look like the one below:

# Products in Shopping Cart:
# 1. Jockey Wheels - Orange - $15.39
# 2. Chain Ring 146mm - $65.95
# 3. Carbon Brake Pads - $92.00
# 4. Front Derailleur - 34.9mm - $31.22

# Discount applied: 20% off on total greater than $100

# TOTAL: $163.65

# Happy coding and good luck! ðŸŽ‰
# Recommendations

# We encourage you to include a README file with any additional information you would like to provide us with. It's a great place to include the getting started how-to, explain your design decisions etc. We recommend you submit your solution as a CLI application in the language your are most comfortable in, keeping in mind we predominantly use Ruby/Rails, Typescript/React, and a bit of Python. Remember to write a clean and well-structured solution and to commit early and often. Feel free to address the problem creatively and keep the extensibility in mind as we ask successful candidates to extend their implementation.
